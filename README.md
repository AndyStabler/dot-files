# dot-files

These are my dot-files.

I didn't want to spend a long time getting set up on new machines so I spent much longer automating the process 🤷‍♀️

Run `./install.sh` to install xcode, brew, brew files, ohmyzsh, ruby, and to initialise dot files.

Once this has run it will have backed up the old dot files. If you're happy with the change, you can run `./setup_dot_files.sh --clean-up` to remove them.
